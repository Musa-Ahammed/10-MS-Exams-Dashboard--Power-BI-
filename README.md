A brief write-up summarizing key findings and any assumptions made
This 10 Minute School exam dashboard provides valuable insights into student engagement, performance trends, and exam behavior across a defined period.
1. Student Engagement:
A total of 300 students participated in 1,823 sessions across 12 unique exams.


The highest-attempted exam was সাপ্তাহিক পরীক্ষা - ১ with 351 attempts, followed by Monthly Exam 1 (MCQ) with 257.


2. Performance Trends:
The most improved student gained 26.25 marks between two attempts, indicating notable learning progress.


However, performance decline was common, especially in Monthly Exam 1 (MCQ) (218 students) and multiple Class 10 Weekly Exams.



3. Decline Rates:
Interestingly, while Monthly Exam 1 (MCQ) had the most students with declined scores, it recorded the lowest decline rate (29.36%), suggesting its design aligns well with student capabilities.
4. Exam Behavior Patterns:
The peak exam activity occurred on February 1, 2025, with 155 attempts in a single day.


A significant drop in participation was observed from March 24 to April 11, possibly due to academic breaks.


Saturdays emerged as the most popular exam day, highlighting student preference.




Assumptions:
Ranking for similar marks has been ordered by exam_ends_at.


Decline/improvement is based on a student’s sequential attempts.


These findings help in refining exam strategies, aligning content difficulty, and improving engagement to support better learning outcomes.
